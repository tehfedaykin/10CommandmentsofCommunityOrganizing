		content="“Why’d you have to go and make things so complicated?” - Avril Lavigne, implementing Angular forms in 2019

Forms are such a basic part of web applications; how did they get so complicated? This talk will walk through Angular template driven vs. reactive forms and use cases for their implementation, basic & more complex form-validation, & custom component implementations like typeahead and date-pickers. This talk will also include some useful workarounds for those more complex PITA requirements that always seem to pop up in projects.">
